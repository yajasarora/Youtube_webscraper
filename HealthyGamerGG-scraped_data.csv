🧘 The tradition of meditation teaches that doubt is the opposite of discipline, and resolve is the antidote to doubt.

💡 Resolve is an emotion that can help cultivate discipline.

🧠 Cultivating resolve is important for discipline, and yoga can help with this.

🔥 Cultivating resolve and discipline through emotional engagement.

💡 Discipline is an emotion and numbing our negative emotions also numbs the positive ones.

🧠 Smart kids often end up lonely due to their one-dimensional identity as being smart.

🧠 The perception of being smart can lead to a narrowing of possibilities and a narrowing of identity, resulting in social isolation.

 🧠 Smart kids who lack social engagement may rely on their intelligence to solve social problems, leading to cognitive exhaustion and social isolation.

🧠 Loneliness and defensive arrogance can lead to low self-esteem, and using intelligence to boost ego is not effective.

💡 People with high IQ often rely on their intelligence to solve external problems, but struggle with emotional healing and self-esteem.

🤔 The core problem for smart kids is that they base their identity on things outside of their control, leading to a fear of failure and a reluctance to try their best.

👥 Engaging in human touch and taking small steps is important for personal growth and overcoming loneliness.

Hugging people leads to a release of oxytocin and facilitates bonding, but not everyone may want a hug.

Many individuals with depression, including those with subclinical depression, may try to analyze their situation logically to pull themselves out of it, but they often find themselves unable to do so. Moreover, some people with depression may be highly logical and reach the conclusion that there is no reason to live. Dr. K explains that this is because the amygdala becomes hyper-reactive in people with depression, causing them to become hypersensitive to negativity and amplify negative information.

To address depression, Dr. K recommends developing emotional awareness through therapy, meditation, and journaling. These practices can help individuals process emotions and change flawed assumptions, which can ultimately help them tackle hopelessness and use logic to find lasting solutions. Dr. K emphasizes the importance of recognizing the limitations of logic in dealing with depression and the need to address the emotional aspects of the problem to find effective solutions.

Truthfully, we weren't sure where the line was when editing this video, so we asked Mitch for guidance. With his permission, we are leaving the video unedited and sharing the following communication:

""Hi Dr. K + Team. Mitch's manager Sam here. We've decided that it's only the right and most honest thing for us to keep the VOD unedited and raw (on our end). It was obviously an extremely difficult conversation for Mitch to have, but this is part of Mitch's healing process and truthfully what his art is about. It's about no longer 'editing' out parts of him to appeal to the world.""

In today's interview, Dr. K finally meets his match. Just like in video games, Dr. K peers into the dark mirror, only to discover the final raid boss in the form of an 18 year old Korean girl with bunny ears. 

The way to increase self-worth is by understanding that your identity and self-worth is based on the reflection of people around you, and then change it to be based on yourself in isolation, not in relation to anyone else. Give yourself a sense of worth and identity based on yourself. Accept who you are, where you are and then play your game.

Amouranth has many external pressures and channels to min-max, so there is a ton of things to worry about, take care of, and ultimately burnout on.

Facts or feelings or feelings over facts? Even if we know rationally what we must do, our feelings typically dictate what we do. In this part of the HealthyGamer Mental Health Bootcamp, Dr. K talks about alexithymia or how men suppress their emotions. Suppressing emotions leads to men not being able to detect their emotions which can make it hard to deal with certain mental health issues. These mental health issues in turn cause problems like acting irrationally without knowing it.  The HealthyGamer mental health Bootcamp aims to equip our viewers with the knowledge to help them overcome common mental health issues.

In this video, Dr. K talks about why men suppress emotions and what can be done about emotional suppression.

Dr. K from HealthyGamer talks with a viewer who is on the verge of dropping out of his graduate school program. The stress of graduate school is something common amongst higher education. Graduate students are put to high standards because their teachers and professors were also put to near-impossible standards. The graduate school cycle of abuse thus continues. Graduate schools and medical schools stress students because that is how things have been, but this also causes mental health issues for graduate students. Life can be hard for grad students.

In this video, Dr. K talks with a viewer about failure in a graduate school program and why failure is actually freedom.

ADHD is a diagnosis that is skyrocketing in the United States. Due to the high amount of ADHD diagnoses, this means that ADHD is not necessarily caused strictly by ADHD genes. This could mean that ADHD is caused by environmental factors like the internet with social media and youtube. Dealing with ADHD is difficult as your mind shifts from topic to topic. 

In this video, Dr. K shows Mizkif how to manage his ADHD.

Dharma is the Sanskrit word for duty or responsibility, however it also has the connotation of purpose. Purpose is an elusive concept in twitch chat. Many streamers, chatters, and even employees may feel like they lack purpose times.

Purpose can be explored through the hero's journey. The Hero's Journey is a narrative structure that exists within many different cultures, but as a concept was made popular by Joseph Campbell. Lord of the Rings follows the hero's journey narrative, which is analogous to fulfilling one's purpose in life. Today, many people feel purposeless, either because they haven't found their purpose or because they feel like they have failed their purpose. Lord of the Rings encapsulates both of these as characters undergo strife,  conflict with their purpose, but ultimately fulfilling their purpose.

In this video, Dr. K explains why having a purpose is the ultimate motivator.

Dharma is a bit different from morality since dharma is duty or responsibility. Morality encapsulates good vs evil. It is possible that your dharma or life purpose isn't necessarily good nor evil. Dharma is about responsibility which sort of goes outside the range of morality.

In this video, Dr. K shares a story of Bhishma to explain Dharma.

Learning how to learn is a skill that isn't taught outright. However, through examining the self, optimal learning can be achieved. Learning when the mind is pliable rather than stress is the key to learning. Having a still mind helps people reach optimal learning.

A large ego grows when we rely on external sources for validation. Ego is the part of our brain that wants to control situations. Meditation can help in controlling ego. This meditation is good because our internal sources of self-esteem are bombarded with validations like how many friends or followers we have. Social media can have a part in destroying self-esteem, confidence, and mental health. By controlling the ego, we can have better self-esteem and mental health. With a lessened ego, it is easier to look within.

Knowing yourself means having internal standards. These are deemed as subjective, but individuality plays a major role in health and medicine and science is amazing for finding averages of people. This creates an external standard that we can hold ourselves to feel safe in optimizing how we approach mental disease and disorders. However, this can get in the way of knowing ourselves. Choosing the right times to trust our knowledge of self can be lifechanging.

In this video, Dr. K and Devin Nash discuss external standards, internal standards, and why meditation can help remove some misdirection of external standards and averages. Ultimately, holding oneself to an internal standard comes down to knowing yourself.
